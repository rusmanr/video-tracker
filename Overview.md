# Introduction #

**video-tracker**

A openCV video tracker using Condensation and Kalman filter

# Details #
This project aims to develop an implementation of Kalman filter and Condensation filter to track simple videos, like a bouncing ball or a remote-controlled machine. The project is developed in C++ programming language, using openCV to process videos and HighGUI to create the user interface. Another goal of the project is to generate statistics about the quality of the used algorithms. This project is born to a course of Senior Informatic Engineering at the University of Florence from three junior engineers. The project is released under the GNU General Public License.
