This project aims to develop an implementation of **Kalman** filter and **Condensation** filter to track simple videos, like a bouncing ball or a remote-controlled machine.
The project is developed in C++ programming language, using openCV to process videos and HighGUI to create the user interface.
Another goal of the project is to generate statistics about the quality of the used algorithms.
This project is born to a course of Senior Informatic Engineering at the University of Florence from three junior engineers.
